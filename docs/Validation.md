# Objective of the model
To understand how individual decisions at household level influence moving behaviour in cities to cause the emergence of the Zipf's law. 

# Validation
Did we build the right thing?
- i.e. do the model outcomes correspond with reality?
- in classical scientific discourse this means, does a theoretical model make correct predictions

## Methods of validation
- Historic replay
- Face validation through expert consultation
- Literature validation
- Model replication

Historic replay does not suit our model as our model studies the reasons for the occurrence of a type of behaviour and not the behaviour itself. 

Model replication is done by making another model of the same system, with different people. If the outcomes are the same or similar, this indicates the model is valid. However, in our case this validation method is not useful as we do not have the resources or people to make another model with. 

Face validation through expert consultation is a good method to validate our model.
Literature validation can also be used.

### Face validation through expert consultation
The model consists of two parts, the life stage progression of households and the moving behaviour of households. The first part can be validated through expert consultation by discussing the assumptions made in the model logic and by showing them how the number of households changes through time.

The second part of the model, the moving behaviour of households, can be validated by discussing the underlying assumptions of this part of the model. Lastly, the emergent behaviour of the number of households per city can be shown so that the outcome of the model based on the choices made can be discussed.
